 
GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SYSTEM (GIS) 
A system that creates, manages, analyses and maps all types of data. GIS connects all types of data to a map 
with all descriptive information hence providing a foundation for mapping and analysis that is used in science 
and almost all types of industry. GIS help users to understand patterns, relationships and geographical 
relationships in data. 
A GIS can be viewed as a computer-based system used in the collection, maintenance, storage, analysis, 
output, and distribution of spatial data and information. It quantifies these locations by recording their 
coordinates, numbers that describe the position of these features on earth. 
A geographic information system (GIS) is a computer system for capturing, storing, checking, and 
displaying data related to positions on Earth’s surface 
Spatial data is any type of data that directly or indirectly references a specific geographical area or location. 
Sometimes called geospatial data or geographic information, spatial data can also numerically represent a 
physical object in a geographic coordinate system. 
 
COMPONENTS OF GIS 
GIS applications include both hardware (GIS devices) and software systems. These software applications may 
include cartographic data, photographic data, digital data, or data in spreadsheets. 
Devices used in GIS 
GIS data collection devices include the following: 
Digitizers: Hardware device that receives analog information, such as sound or light, and records it digitally. 
Usually, the information is stored in a file on a computing device. GIS professionals can use digitizers to easily 
capture, store, analyze, and manage data while in the field. Examples of digitizers are digital cameras, tablets, 
scanners. 
GPS Units: Any device used to receive information from GPS satellites and calculating your geographical 
position. The Geographical Positioning Unit (GPS) was originally developed by US government for military 
use but now any one can use GPD device. Commonly used in surveying and mapping. 
Mobile devices: Various mobile devices with professional GIS features are used as GPS hardware used in data 
collection 

Devices used in GIS 
Desktop Computer - You’ll need a large-display monitor, lots of RAM (more than 4 GB recommended), 
and plenty of extra space on the hard drive where you can upload your data for later use 
Printer – Incredibly useful because they allow you to bring your digital map into the physical world. Once you print 
a map you can hang it on the office wall, distribute to your teams, or simply keep as reference 
Key features for your GIS 
desktop computer 
 
Categories of Data used in GIS 
Cartographic data 
Data already in map form, and may include such information as the location of rivers, roads, hills, and valleys. 
Cartographic data may also include survey data and mapping information that can be directly entered into a 
GIS. 
Photographic data 
Photographic interpretation is a major part of GIS. Photo interpretation involves analyzing aerial photographs 
and assessing the features that appear. 
Digital data 
Digital data can also be entered into GIS. An example of this kind of information is computer data collected by
satellites that show land use—the location of farms, towns, and forests. 
Spreadsheet 
GIS can also include data in table or spreadsheet form, such as population demographics. Demographics can 
range from age, income, and ethnicity. 
GIS Software Applications 
GIS software provides the tools to manage, analyze, and effectively display and disseminate spatial 
information. We need tools to view and edit these data, manipulate them to generate and extract the 
information we require, and produce the materials to communicate the information we have developed. 

Main functions of GIS software include: 
(1) Data Entry (3)Data Management (5) Output 
- Manual data capture - Documentation - hardcopy Printing 
- Digital data capture - Compression - Graphic design 
- Data import - Summarizing - Map design 
 - copy, emerge - Export format generation 
 
(2) Editing (4) Analysis 
- Feature editing - Attribute query 
- Automated error detection - Spatial query 
- Attribute editing - buffering 
 - terrain analysis

Common types of Files used in ArcMap 
• Geodatabase – Geodatabases define, manage, process and store all the types of data that can be
used in ArcGIS (i.e., feature, rasters, relationships, measurements, attributes, etc) inside either a 
Microsoft Access database (.mdb) or a full relational database (SQL Server) 
• Shapefiles - shapefile format is a widely adopted standard and comprises three or more associated 
files stores various shapes. They use .shp or shx extension. 
• Layer – (.lyr) stores symbology, symbology classifications, labeling properties, scale dependency, and 
definition. 
• Coverages – “A coverage stores a set of thematically associated data considered to be a unit. It
usually represents a single layer, such as soils, streams, roads, or land use. 
• Image formats – ArcGIS accepts and uses a variety of image files (.tiff, .jpg, .jp2, .png, etc). 
• Text files commonly for storing (with x,y coordinates) 
• Map document (.mxd) A map used to store maps on a file on disk with extension mxd. Each map 
document contains the specifications for the map layers, the page layout, and all other map 
properties. Map documents make it easy to save, reuse, and share your work in ArcMap. ArcMap 
uses .mxt extension as the default for templates created

ESSENTIAL TERMS TO KNOW IN ARCMAP 
Layer
A map layer defines how a GIS dataset is symbolized and labeled in your map views. Each layer represents 
geographic data in ArcMap such as a particular theme of data. Example map layers include streams and lakes, 
terrain, roads, political boundaries, parcels, building footprints, utility lines etc. Layers can have different 
features that can be used differentiate them for example: 
• Point (e.g., buildings, landmarks). Zero-dimensional. 
• Line, or arc (e.g., roads and streets, streams, railroads, power lines). One-dimensional. 
• Polygon (e.g., political entities, census geographies such as tracts). Two-dimensional. 
• Raster images (e.g., an aerial photograph, scanned topographic map, or an elevation model). 
Table of contents 
The table of contents lists all the layers on the map and shows what the features in each layer represent. The 
check box next to each layer indicates whether its display is currently turned on or off. The order of layers 
within the table of contents specifies their drawing order in the data frame from bottom to top 
Table of Contents 
Labels
Labels are text strings that are used to label features within map layers. Properties define the attribute 
column used as the source of the text string and how the label is portrayed in your map. 
Basemap
A collection of GIS data that form the background setting for a map. The function of the basemap is to
provide background detail necessary to orient the location of the map. Typical GIS data make up the layers 
for a basemap: streets, boundaries, waterways, and aerial or satellite images. 
Theme – IS a single layer of data for example Housing 
 
View - is a collection of themes 
ArcMap Interface 
Catalog 
Search 
ArcMap Interface 
The ArcMap interface is composed several tool bars such as the standard tool bar, tools tool bar etc. Each tool bar 
perform a number of functions. Use your mouse to point to each of the icons on the tool bars to discover their 
functions. 
 Feel free to drag the tool bar and place it any 
position of your convenience. 
Description of the Key Interface items of ArcMap 
Menu Bar – Displays all items of the main menu of the application such File, Edit, Bookmarks …. 
Table of contents – Used as a panel to display different layers. The table of contents can also be displayed 
from Windows n the main menu, so is the Catalog and Search. Note that Catalog can be opened in a 
separate Window but it is convenient to access it via ArcMap. The catalog is helpful when one want to
connect or access contents from different folders with ease. 
To open files using Catalog, simply navigate to the file you want to open and drag it into the ArcMap 
display area. 
The search panel on Windows is very useful for searching for tools used in ArcMap. However, for new users 
of the application, it may not be of great importance because one does not know what to search. It is
advisable that new users of the application use the tool box to explore the tools or functions within the 
system.

One of the common operations in Catalog windows is the drag and drop once you have connected your folders 
containing the data. 
1. Open Catalog window 
2. Browse the connected folder containing the GIS data you want to view 
3. Drag and drop the shapefile into the table of contents 
Dragged Map layer 
Changing the Layers Display Order 
ArcMap allows users to add more than one year in the ToC in a predefined order depending on the layer 
that was placed in the ToC panel. Nevertheless, it permits reorganizing and change the display of layers 
based on the users’ preference. Steps
1. Open add more than two layers in the table of contents say: Uganda tertiary institutions; Uganda 
wild life reserves and Uganda Cities 2020.
2. Make sure the List by drawing Order button in the ToC is selected 
3. Drag and drop the item you want to relocate from the current position to a new location 
In the ToC change the existing map layers to 
appear in the following order from the top: 
 
1) Uganda Wildlife reservations 
2) Uganda School Tertiary institutions 
3) District boundaries 2018 
4) Cities 2020 
Changing the Map Layers Color and Symbols 
In ArcGIS has functionalities for changing the colors and symbols of Map layers. The ArcMap users can change 
colors of existing Map layers to their preference and save them in new location under new file names. In the 
example, we shall change the color of Uganda Wild Reserve Map layer to new colors 
Place the Uganda Wild Reserve in the Table of Contents using the Drag and Drop – Catalog method 
Right Click the Legend below the Map layer 
Select the preference color

move the next extent. 
Additional Navigation Functions in ArcMap 
ArcMap provides three additional map windows to view the spatial data on your map: 
 
1) Magnifier window - The Magnifier window works like a magnifying glass: as you pass the window over 
the data, you see a magnified view of the location under the window
2) Viewer window - A Viewer window behaves like an independent view onto the map, and you can use 
any of the ArcMap interactive tools inside the window. 
3) Overview window. The Overview window uses a box to show the extent of your display view within the 
total extent of your data. You can use the Overview window to navigate the map in the Data view display.
Note 
Windows Overview, Magnifier and Viewer 
are only active in when Map layer is in 
Data view mode. Hence cannot be used in 
Data Layout 
Measuring Distance on a Map

Setting Selectable Map Layers 
When working with many layers in the ToC, you can 
determine which layers you want to select features from 
by disabling some layers that might not be put to use. 
Once you set layers selectable ArcMap will only enable 
you to highlight layers from the selectable layers 
Steps 
• Open the layers in your Table of Contents for example: 
Districts, Counties, Sub counties 
• Click on the Icon of List by Selection in the ToC 
• Click off the Selection Boxes for Parishes and Counties 
• ArcMap sets the ticked boxes layers as unselectable layers. 
• Click the Select Feature function 
• Choose by graphic you want to use such Rectangle, Polygon, 
Circle or Line as you wish

Creating New Layers from Selected Map Layer 
In ArcMap, you can create new layer using the selected 
features in the mother layer. For example you can create 
layers for particular district from a particular mother 
layer that has all districts 
Steps 
• Select the features of your choice as illustrated in the 
previous slides 
• Right Click the mother layer say district in the ToC 
• Click Create layer from selected features 
• A new layer is created. Use the ToC to put off some 
layers so that you can display the new created layer. 
New Created District Layers for Masindi and Kiryandogo 
Working with Attributes Tables 
Attribute Tables are commonly associated with spatial 
data that forms the map layer and the attribute values 
contained. 
The Attribute tables can be used to find and query 
data in ArcMap. Attribute tables can be a tabular file 
containing information about a set of geographic 
features, usually arranged so that each row represents 
a feature and each column represents one feature 
attribute. 
To Open Attribute table for existing Map layer, take the 
following steps: 
• Rick Click the Map layer in ToC you want to see the 
attribute table for example districts 
• Click on Open Attribute Table 
• Navigate to the any record of your choice in the 
table and Click its Row record. 
• Note that the selected record is also highlighted in
the Map Layer. Right Click – Zoom, identify, Pan 
and use the tools tool bar to take measurements

display only the selected records. 
• Use the selected record Icon to view only the 
selected records. 
• To view all records click on the All records 
Icon 
All records are displayed Displays only selected records 
Switching Selections 
With ArcMap, you can switch sections of the map layers that 
have been selected in the attributes table, select all records 
and unselected records. 
The attributes table has an area for options found on the 
extreme left hand side. 
Click the Table options button in the Attributes table 
Try the following options: Find to search for any feature, 
Switch selection to navigate between selection, Select All to 
select all records and Clear selection to unclear all selected 
records

Moving or relocating fields in the Attributes Table 
 ArcMap permits users to rearrange fields in the 
attributes table using the drag and drop method. 
For example in the District Map layer you can move 
the column for Female to appear before Male. Note 
that all corresponding data are moved. 
Steps: 
• Open the District Map Layer in the ToC 
• Right Click District in the TOC 
• Open Attributes Table 
• Click and Drag and Release the Female 
headings to the Left hand side. Note now it 
appears before Male 
Click and Drag to the left hand side 
Sorting Fields in the Attributes Table 
ArcMap allows sorting of fields in the 
attributes table either in ascending or 
descending order as per the users’ 
preference. Once fields are sorted, all 
associated data in the records correspond 
accordingly. For example districts can be 
sorted in ascending order in the district 
table. 
Steps 
• Place the District map layer in the table of 
contents 
• Right Click District in the ToC 
• Select Open attributes Table 
• Right Click the column heading for the 
district 
• Select either Ascending or descending 
Column heading for right clicking 
Advanced Sorting of Fields 
At time one may need to reoragnise fields in series 
of order where some fields under particular 
column headings have several related fields. For 
example you want to sort districts in ascending 
order and in each district you sort sex in 
descending order. In this situation district 
becomes the field to sort followed by sex 
Steps 
• Place the District map layer in the table of 
contents 
• Right Click District in the ToC 
• Select Open attributes Table 
• Right Click the column heading for the district 
• Select Advanced sorting 
• Select Sort by district - Ascending 
• Select Sort by sex - Descending 
Sort by District 
Sort by sex 
Getting Statistics in the attributes Table 
We can obtain descriptive statistics such as mean, max, min, 
sum and standard deviation in columns that store numeric data 
in the attributes table. A histogram is also provided showing 
how the column's values are distributed. Statistics are calculated 
for all numeric columns in the table. We shall use the districts 
map layer to get some descriptive statistics on male, female and 
total population. 
Steps 
• Place the Districts Map layer in full extent in the ToC 
• Right Click District in the ToC 
• Choose Make this as the only selectable layer 
• Hold Shift key and use select features tool to select the 
districts of Jinja, Masaka, Mable

Label Features 
Labels are text items on a map layer that are 
delivered from one or more feature attributes that 
are displayed in the ArcMap windows depending on 
the scale. For example in the map of layer of districts 
you may want to display male population for each 
district 
Steps 
• Place the district shapefile in the ToC 
• Right Click Districts layer in the ToC 
• Select properties 
• Select the Label Tab

Geoprocessing
It involves extracting subset spatial features of map layer using 
attributes or queries, aggregating polygons into larger 
polygons as well as appending two layers into a single map. 
Queries help in easily retrieve data based on set parameters. 
Data retrieved using queries can later be manipulated for 
various purposes. 
Using Data queries to Extra features of your Map layer
